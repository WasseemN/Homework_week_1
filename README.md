## Results
* On July 7th 2021, Wise listed on the London Stock Exchange valued at £8 billion, which made it London's largest ever tech listing.
* Key peformance indicators that explain Wise's grrowth are shown below:

| Active customers| Total volume | Personal VPC | Business VPC | Total Take rate |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| 7.4m | £76.4bn | £8,110 | £47,731 | 0.73% |
| YoY 4%| YoY 40%| YoY 9%| YoY 18%| -0.03%|  
* Remitly, which was also founded in 2011, profits from adding a mark-up to the mid-market exchange rate. Revolut only apply the mark-up for non-weekday transfers, uncommon traded currencies and larger sums of transfer. Wise only uses mid-market exchange rate. A Bloomber Second Measure analysis performed on November 2021 revealed that Wise accounts for almost half of the money exchanged by U.S consumers among a selection of at the time leading money transfer platforms.

* Investing in utilizing blockchain technologies for services such as decentralized finance (DeFi) can be a smart move for the company to steer towards. More and more it seems that the future of finance and banking is accepting the notion of blockchain and cryptocurrencies. Such is seen with Jp Morgan's new JPM Coin which is a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar. 
* Technologies that may be utilized in developing DeFI solutions will require Ethereum smart contract development using Solidity platform.
